# test-rhythm_game
Proof of concept of a simple grid-based rhythm game running in Love2D.

# Requirements
* Love2D
* The sound file and background for AM-3P, a copyrighted song from Bemani
The sound file should immediately start with the song. Use a sound editor to cut off the blank in the beginning if needed to.

# Controls
* WASD: Move red square
* Arrow keys: Move blue square

# Goal
Move a square to a note of a corresponding color. If blue, blue square moves there. Red and blue together will form purple. This is used for purple notes.
